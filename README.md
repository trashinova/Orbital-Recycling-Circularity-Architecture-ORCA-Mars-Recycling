# Orbital-Recycling-Circularity-Architecture-ORCA-Mars-Recycling
ORCA (Orbital Recycling & Circularity Architecture) is a youth-led innovation tackling Mars waste challenges, where traditional disposal is impossible and resupply limited. Designed by a dynamic youth team, all high schoolers from Dhaka, showcasing fresh talent in space innovation, it fuses MIRU’s mechanical shred/melt/extrude tech with BICL’s bio-inspired metabolism, transforming inorganics into habitat resources. This zero-waste system supports Renovations (reusing foams/alloys for structures), Celebrations (turning pouches into morale-boosting décor), and Discoveries (repurposing carbon-based waste into advanced material loops)—maximizing recovery with minimal energy and water. A global “Wish Wall” portal connects Earthlings to Martians, fostering cultural ties and STEM inspiration. ORCA shifts exploration from exploitative to regenerative, proving young innovators can pioneer sustainable space futures.
